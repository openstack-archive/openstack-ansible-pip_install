# If you want to use your own keys for UCA or RDO (instead of ubuntu or
# CentOS defaults), please define user_external_repo_key_list, a list
# of dictionaries, each dict with keys/values corresponding to the
# ansible module arguments for your distribution.
#
# For CentOS you'd define the following:
#user_external_repo_keys_list:
#  - key: https://my-repo.example.com/signing-key.asc
# You could also use key: <keyid> from a keyserver, see ansible rpm_key doc.
# Validate cert option from the module is also supported.
# In CentOS, refusing to use the RDO package also forces you to add your own
# repository. See below to know how to include your own repository.
#
# For Ubuntu, you'd define the following:
#user_external_repo_keys_list:
#  - url: https://my-repo.example.com/signing-key.asc
# This leverages apt_key module, and passes the id, keyserver, and url argument.
# Therefore, you can ensure the id of the key you want to import with id: <keyid>
# or replace the source url with a keyserver.

# If you have defined another set of keys you want to include, the chances are

#user_external_repos_list:
#  - name: "mymirror"
#    baseurl: "http://mymirrorurl/baseurl/"
#See also gpgcheck, gpgkey, description of the Ansible yum_repository module
# For Ubuntu, define something like the following:
#user_external_repos_list:
#  - repo: "deb http://mymirrorurl/ubuntu/ xenial main"
#    filename: "mymirror"
# If your mirror includes UCA mirroring, you may then want to disable using uca
# by setting in your user variables uca_enable: False
